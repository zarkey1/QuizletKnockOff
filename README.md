How Long did it take to make?
- This took about 6 Hours (Kinda Guess, I didnt really time it or anything and i was messing around a lot)
- Why did it take so long, I was trying to come up with the best possible product that was easy to use and i Wanted it to work as fast as it could, so i had to brainstorm new ideas that would make it work how i wanted it to
- It was made in C# .Net Framework
